# Learning Go Standard Library

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my journey of learning the Go programming language, specifically focusing on the **Go Standard Library**. This repository serves as a personal learning space, but I hope it can also be a helpful resource for others who are starting their journey with Go.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains code examples, notes, and projects that I create while exploring the Go Standard Library. The Go Standard Library is a powerful set of packages that provide essential functionality for building robust and efficient applications. My goal is to understand and master these packages to become proficient in Go development.


## 🤝 Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning repository, I welcome contributions! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional examples, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
